# SEM5 - INTEGRATIVE PROJECT|2024/2025

## Scope

This project aims to develop a prototype system for managing surgical appointments and hospital resources. The system will allow hospitals to organize surgical schedules and patient records while providing real-time 3D visualization of resource availability. Additionally, it will ensure compliance with GDPR regulations, addressing data protection and consent management requirements.

## Overview

The goal is to develop a full-stack web system that includes REST APIs, database management, 3D rendering, optimization using Prolog, and privacy law compliance. This web-based system comprises the following modules:

- Backoffice Web Application
  - Manage: medical professionals, patients, operation types, rooms, operation requests.
- 3D Visualization Module
  - Renders the hospital floor.
- Planning and Optimization Module
  - Generate the schedule of surgeries.
  - Opmitize the schedules according to different criteria, the mdedical professionals and rooms availability.
- GDPR Compliance Module
- Business Continuity Plan (BCP) Module

It is assumed that all other medical and patient management functions are handled by other parts of the system and are not included in this prototype.

## Build & Run

To build and run the system simultaneously, you need to execute the following script:

- [build-run-script.bat](build-run-script.bat) for windows operation system
- [build-run-script.sh](build-run-script.sh) for linux operating system.

### Build

To build the system, execute the following script:

- [build-script.bat](build-script.bat) for windows operation system
- [build-script.sh](build-script.sh) for linux operating system.

### Run

To run the system, use the following scripts:

- [run-script.bat](run-script.bat) for windows operation system
- [run-script.sh](run-script.sh) for linux operating system.
