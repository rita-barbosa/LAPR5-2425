## 1. Context

This user story is being implemented for the first time.

## 2. Requirements

**US 7.4.5:** As a system administrator I want the US process of the DB backup to be kept in the Linux log, in an appropriate context, and alert the administrator when accessing the console if a serious failure occurs in this process.

## 3. Analysis

In this user story, we need to configure the logging service to support this feature. The log settings will be adjusted to ensure proper saving, and in case of failure, the administrator will be notified upon accessing the console.
