## 1. Context

This user story is being implemented for the first time.

## 2. Requirements

**US 7.5.4:** As a healthcare staff member, whenever I select a different room, I want the camera (and the spotlight, if applicable) to move smoothly instead of instantly. The animation can either be created or defined using some API, such as tween.js.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- 7.5.4.1: //todo 

**Dependencies/References:**

This user story depends on [7.5.1](../1220683/us-7.5.1/readme.md), as that user story is responsible for implementing the selection of the room feature.

## 3. Analysis

In order to accomplish this user story we will use Tween.js to configure the animation so that the camera moves smoothly upon a room selection.
