## 1. Context

This is the first time this US is being worked on.

## 2. Requirements

**US 7.4.2:** As the organisation's administrator, I want to be presented with a justification for the change(s) to be 
made to the infrastructure in order to ensure a MTD(Maximum Tolerable Downtime) of 20 minutes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**US 7.4.2.1:** The justification must outline the specific infrastructure changes required to achieve an MTD of 20 minutes.

**US 7.4.2.2:** The justification must include technical, operational, and cost considerations for the proposed changes.

**US 7.4.2.3:** The document must provide evidence or analysis demonstrating how the proposed changes will meet the MTD 
requirement.


**Dependencies/References:**

This user story does not have dependencies.

## 3. Analysis

The main objective of this user story is to ensure the organizationâ€™s infrastructure changes align with achieving an MTD
of 20 minutes. This requires identifying weaknesses in the current setup, proposing targeted solutions, and providing 
clear justifications for these changes.

Key considerations include evaluating system reliability, redundancy, and recovery mechanisms. Cost, resource impact, 
and operational feasibility must also be addressed to ensure the proposal is actionable and aligns with organizational goals.
