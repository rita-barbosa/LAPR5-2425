## 1. Context

This is the first time this US is being worked on.

## 2. Requirements

**US 7.4.8:** As the organisation's administrator, I want access management to be implemented that meets the appropriate
security criteria

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**US 7.4.8.1:** Access management must ensure that only authorized users can access the system based on their roles and permissions.

**US 7.4.8.2:** The solution must comply with the organization's security policies and industry standards.


**Dependencies/References:**

This user story does not have dependencies.


## 3. Analysis

This user story aims to implement robust access management to secure the system. The solution must enforce role-based access 
control (RBAC), ensuring users can only access what their roles permit.

Some important considerations include defining roles and permissions, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring 
compliance with relevant security criteria.
