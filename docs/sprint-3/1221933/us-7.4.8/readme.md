## 1. Context

This is the first time this US is being worked on.

## 2. Requirements

**US 7.4.8:** As the organisation's administrator, I want access management to be implemented that meets the appropriate
security criteria

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**US 7.4.8.1:** Access management must ensure that only authorized users can access the system based on their roles and permissions.

**US 7.4.8.2:** The solution must comply with the organization's security policies and industry standards.


**Dependencies/References:**

This user story does not have dependencies.


## 3. Analysis

This user story aims to implement robust access management to secure the system. The solution must enforce role-based access 
control (RBAC), ensuring users can only access what their roles permit.

Some important considerations include defining roles and permissions, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring 
compliance with relevant security criteria.

## 4. Design

### 4.1. Realization

The access management system will implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users access only the resources 
and actions permitted based on their roles. The design will focus on user authentication, role assignment, and permissions
enforcement while adhering to industry security standards.

#### 4.1.1. Roles and Permissions:
* Roles (e.g., Admin, Doctor, Staff, Patient) will define access levels.
* Permissions will control actions like viewing, editing, and deleting records.

#### 4.1.2. Authentication:
* Users will authenticate via Single Sign-On (SSO), username/password.
* Tokens will be used for API authentication.

#### 4.1.3. Authorization and Access Control:
* Users will be assigned roles based on their job function.
* Permissions will be enforced before granting access to resources.

#### 4.1.4. Compliance:
* Audit logging will track access and unauthorized attempts.
* Access reviews will ensure compliance with security policies.

#### 4.1.5. Implementation Plan:
* Define roles, map permissions, set up authentication, develop access control logic, and integrate logging and monitoring.

#### 4.1.6. Testing and Validation:
* Access control tests will ensure users only access authorized resources.
* Security audits will ensure compliance with standards like GDPR.
