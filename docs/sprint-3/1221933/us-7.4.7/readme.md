## 1. Context

This is the first time this US is being worked on.

## 2. Requirements

**US 7.4.7:** As the organisation's administrator, I want to be presented with a BIA (Business Impact Analysis) of the 
final solution, adapting if and where applicable the risk(s) identified in the previous sprint

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**US 7.4.7.1:** The BIA must include a summary of the previously identified risks and their associated impacts.

**US 7.4.7.2:** The BIA must outline mitigation or adaptation strategies for each identified risk.


**Dependencies/References:**

**6.4.4:** It's needed the risks previously identified.


## 3. Analysis

This user story focuses on providing a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) for the final solution. This BIA should address 
the risks identified in the previous sprint, highlighting their impact and any required adaptations.

The main points are:

* The BIA must integrate previously identified risks.
* Ensure that the BIA is clear, actionable, and aligns with organizational priorities.
* A structured approach will ensure the risks are effectively mitigated or adapted where necessary.
