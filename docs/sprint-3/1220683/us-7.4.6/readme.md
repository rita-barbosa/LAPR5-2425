## 1. Context

* This is the first time this user story is being requested.

## 2. Requirements

**US 7.4.6:** As a system administrator, I want the US backup of the DB backup to have a lifetime of no more than 7 (seven) days, except for the US retention of the monthly and annual copies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **7.4.6.1.** The system must automatically delete daily backups older than 7 days without impacting monthly and yearly backups.
- **7.4.6.2.** Monthly backups should be retained for at least 1 year.
- **7.4.6.3.** Yearly backups should be retained indefinitely, or until explicitly deleted by the administrator.

**Dependencies/References:**

* **US 6.4.6:** Database backup feature, which outlines how backups are created and stored.
* Backup retention policies align with regulatory and compliance requirements for data storage.

## 3. Analysis

To implement this user story, the system requires functionality to:

1. Identify and categorize backups (daily, monthly, yearly) based on creation timestamps or naming conventions.
2. Automatically delete backups exceeding their retention period, ensuring no overlap with long-term backups.
3. Allow configuration of retention policies through environment variables or a dedicated management interface.
4. Log all backup retention actions for auditing purposes.
