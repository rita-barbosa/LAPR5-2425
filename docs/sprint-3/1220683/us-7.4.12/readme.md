## 1. Context

* This is the first time this user story is being requested.

## 2. Requirements

**US 7.4.12:** As a system administrator, we need to ensure that backups have been carried out correctly if necessary.
To do this, we must automate their recovery, validating that the system is working at the end (e.g. database - execute a SQL query successfully after recovery).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **7.4.12.1.** The system must provide an automated mechanism to restore backups and validate the process with a predefined test (e.g., executing a SQL query).
- **7.4.12.2.** If the validation test fails, the system must notify the system administrator.
- **7.4.12.3.** Logs of recovery attempts and their outcomes must be maintained for auditing purposes, including timestamps and details of success/failure.
- **7.4.12.4.** The recovery process must be executable on-demand by the system administrator or automatically as part of scheduled tests.

**Dependencies/References:**

* **US 6.4.6:** Database backup feature, which outlines how backups are created and stored.
* **US 7.4.6:** Retention policies and lifecycle management of backups.

## 3. Analysis

To implement this user story, the system requires functionality to:

1. Automate the restoration of backups, ensuring minimal manual intervention.
2. Execute predefined validation checks after the recovery process to confirm system integrity.
3. Integrate alert mechanisms for failed validation attempts.
4. Maintain logs of recovery and validation activities for transparency and troubleshooting.

Recovery operations must be isolated to prevent disruption in active systems.
