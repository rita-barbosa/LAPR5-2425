## 1. Context

This is the first time this user story is presented.

## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.20:**  As an Admin, I want to add new types of operations, so that I can reflect the available medical procedures 
in the system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- 5.1.20.1. | Admins can add new operation types with attributes like: Operation Name, Required Staff by Specialization, Estimated Duration.

- 5.1.20.2. | The system validates that the operation name is unique.

- 5.1.20.3. | The system logs the creation of new operation types and makes them available for scheduling immediately.


**Dependencies/References:**

This functionality does not have dependencies.

**Client Clarifications:**

> **Question:** Will there be a list of specializations in the system?
>
> **Answer:** Yes, a predefined list of specializations will be provided, but the system should allow for future additions.
