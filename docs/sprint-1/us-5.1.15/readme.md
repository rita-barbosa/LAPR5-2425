## 1. Context

This is the first time this user story is being presented.

## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.15:** As an Admin, I want to list/search staff profiles, so that I can see the details, edit, and remove staff profiles.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

- 5.1.15.1. | Admins can search staff profiles by attributes such as name, email, or specialization.

- 5.1.15.2. | The system displays search results in a list view with key staff information (name, email, specialization).

- 5.1.15.3. | Admins can select a profile from the list to view, edit, or deactivate.

- 5.1.15.4. | The search results are paginated, and filters are available for refining the search results.

**Dependencies/References:**

This feature is dependent on the existence of staff profiles previously created by the Admin (5.1.12), as well as the functionalities
to edit (5.1.13) and remove/deactivate (5.1.14) them.
