## 1. Context

This is the first time this user story is presented.

## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.11:** As an Admin, I want to list/search patient profiles by different attributes, so that I can view the details, edit, and remove patient profiles.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- 5.1.11.1. | Admins can search patient profiles by various attributes, including name, email, date of birth, or medical record number.

- 5.1.11.2. | The system displays search results in a list view with key patient information (name, email, date of birth).

- 5.1.11.3. | Admins can select a profile from the list to view, edit, or delete the patient record.

- 5.1.11.4. | The search results are paginated, and filters are available to refine the search results.

**Dependencies/References:**

This feature is dependent on the existence of patient profiles previously created by the Admin (5.1.8), as well as the functionalities
to edit (5.1.9) and remove (5.1.10) them.
