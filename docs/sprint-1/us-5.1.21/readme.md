## 1. Context

This is the first time this User Story is being worked on. 
This User Story is related to the Admin.

## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.21:** As an Admin, I want to edit existing operation types, so that I can update or correct information about the procedure. 

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **5.1.21.1. -** Admins can search for and select an existing operation type to edit. 

- **5.1.21.2. -** Editable fields include operation name, required staff by specialization, and estimated duration. 

- **5.1.21.3. -** Changes are reflected in the system immediately for future operation requests. 

- **5.1.21.4. -** Historical data is maintained, but new operation requests will use the updated operation type information. 

**Dependencies/References:**

- **US 5.1.1. -** US 5.1.21. is dependent on this User Story as it depends on an existing account of a staff in the system.

- **US 5.1.20. -** US 5.1.21. is dependent on this User Story as it depends on an existing operation type in the system.

- **US 5.1.23. -** This User Story is dependent on US 5.1.21 as it needs it's functionality to work as intended.
