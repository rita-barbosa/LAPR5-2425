## 1. Context

This is the first time this user story is presented.

## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.17:** As a Doctor, I want to update an operation requisition, so that the Patient has access to the necessary healthcare

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- 5.1.17.1. | Doctors can update operation requests they created (e.g., change the deadline or priority).

- 5.1.17.2. | The system checks that only the requesting doctor can update the operation request.

- 5.1.17.3. | The system logs all updates to the operation request (e.g., changes to priority or deadline).

- 5.1.17.4. | Updated requests are reflected immediately in the system and notify the Planning Module of any changes.


**Dependencies/References:**

This functionality is dependent on the creation of a operation requisition (US 5.1.16) by a Doctor registered in the healthcare 
system (US 5.1.12 and US 5.1.1).
