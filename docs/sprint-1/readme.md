**Note:**  It is important to note that user story 5.1.3 will be handled collaboratively by two team members, Ana Guterres and José Santos. Additionally, user stories 5.1.6 and 5.1.7 will also be shared among the assigned team members, as they are quite similar. The team will work closely on these user stories to ensure consistency.

### Observations

To ensure smooth project management and progress tracking, we've implemented the following aspects:

1. **Project Management Tool:** Jira has been chosen as our project management tool.

2. **User Story Breakdown:** Each user story has been divided into smaller, manageable tasks in line with the engineering process. These tasks include analysis, requirements gathering, design, implementation, and testing. This structure provides a clearer understanding of the progress for each user story and helps facilitate an organized division of commits, addressing concerns raised by some team members about work visibility and task tracking.

3. **Separation of Implementation and Testing:** In order to maintain objectivity and improve quality, the testing of each user story will be conducted by a team member other than the one who implemented it. This ensures that all code is reviewed and validated by a fresh perspective, helping to identify any overlooked issues.

4. **Code Reviews:** During the implementation phase, there will be at least one code review for each user story to ensure quality and adherence to coding standards. The code review will be performed by the same team member who is responsible for testing the user story. Additional reviews may be conducted based on the complexity and state of the project. This process helps in catching potential issues early and improves the overall quality of the codebase.

5. **Task Deadlines:** Deadlines have been set for each of the tasks to ensure the team consistently progresses towards project goals. This also ensures that everyone remains accountable, preventing anyone from falling behind or slacking off.

6. **Sprint Closure:** The final day of each sprint will be reserved for reviewing the work completed, conducting self-evaluations, and holding a sprint retrospective. This means that all planned tasks must be completed by the day before the sprint ends. If any tasks are left unfinished due to a lack of responsibility or effort from a team member, they will be held accountable in subsequent evaluations, reinforcing the importance of commitment and accountability.

7. **Daily Logs:** Each team member will maintain daily logs to track and document their work. This helps in providing transparency and allows for better progress tracking, ensuring that everyone is contributing to the project consistently.

These practices have been put in place to enhance team collaboration, ensure timely delivery of tasks, and maintain high-quality standards throughout the project.

## Sprint Retrospective

* What Went Well:
Our team adapted swiftly and effectively to the new work environment and subject matter, tackling challenges with a proactive mindset. We improved communication channels, which streamlined collaboration, and we took a successful approach to integrating new technologies into our workflow.

* Challenges Faced:
Client clarifications sometimes caused confusion, leading to unnecessary feature implementations. We also faced adaptation issues with the testing model due to limited examples and time constraints. A specific issue within an aggregate grew in complexity, and there was a lack of prioritization management, particularly between the IAM system and aggregate roots.

* Areas for Improvement:
We could benefit from bringing issues to the team sooner for faster and proactive resolutions. Additionally, adopting a more flexible approach in the engineering process could improve our adaptability and outcomes.
