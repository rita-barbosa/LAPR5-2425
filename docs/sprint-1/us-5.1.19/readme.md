## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.19:** As a Doctor, I want to list/search operation requisitions, so that I see the details, edit, and remove operation requisitions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- 5.1.19.1: Doctors can search operation requests by patient name, operation type, priority, and status.

- 5.1.19.2: The system displays a list of operation requests in a searchable and filterable view.

- 5.1.19.3: Each entry in the list includes operation request details (e.g., patient name, operation type, 
status).

- 5.1.19.1: Doctors can select an operation request to view, update, or delete it.

**Dependencies/References:**

This user story is connected to user stories 5.1.17 and 5.1.18, as they pertain to the update and delete functionalities, respectively. As a result, this user story will be directly related, since it needs to be capable of selecting an operation request for updating or deleting.

**Client Clarifications:**

> **Question:** One of the acceptance criteria mentions that doctors can search for operation requests by status. What does "status" refer to in this context?
>
> **Answer:** _Waiting for client clarifications._


> **Question:** When listing operation requests, should only those associated with the specific doctor be displayed?
>
> **Answer:** _Waiting for client clarifications._

> **Question:** What information needs to be displayed when listing the operation requestsâ€”should it correspond to the filtering criteria? If so, when selecting the operation request to view the only new attribute is the deadline date.
>
> **Answer:** _Waiting for client clarifications._
