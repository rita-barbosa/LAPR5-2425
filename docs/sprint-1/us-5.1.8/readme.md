## 1. Context

This is the first time this user story is worked on.

## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.8:** As an Admin, I want to create a new patient profile, so that I can register their personal details and medical history.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- 5.1.8.1:  Admins can input patient details such as first name, last name, date of birth, contact information, and medical history.

- 5.1.8.2: A unique patient ID (Medical Record Number) is generated upon profile creation.

- 5.1.8.3: The system validates that the patientâ€™s email and phone number are unique.
 
- 5.1.8.4: The profile is stored securely in the system, and access is governed by role-based permissions.

**Dependencies/References:**

This user story does not have dependencies.


**Client Clarifications:**

> **Question:** How are duplicate patient profiles handled when registered by both the patient and admin?
>
> **Answer:** The system checks the email for uniqueness. The admin must first create the patient record, and then the patient can register using the same email.
