## 1. Context

This is the first time this User Story is being worked on. 
This User Story is related to the Admin.

## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.10:**  As an Admin, I want to delete a patient profile, so that I can remove patients who are no longer under care. 

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **5.1.10.1. -** Admins can search for a patient profile and mark it for deletion. 

- **5.1.10.2. -** Before deletion, the system prompts the admin to confirm the action. 

- **5.1.10.3. -** Once deleted, all patient data is permanently removed from the system within a predefined time frame. 

- **5.1.10.4. -** The system logs the deletion for audit and GDPR compliance purposes. 

**Dependencies/References:**

- **US 5.1.3. -** US 5.1.10. is dependent on this User Story as it depends on an existing profile of a patient in the system.

- **US 5.1.11. -** This User Story is dependent on US 5.1.10 as it needs it's functionality to work as intended.

**Client Clarifications:**
