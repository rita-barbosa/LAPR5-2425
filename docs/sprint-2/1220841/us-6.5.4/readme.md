## 1. Context

This is the first time this user story is worked on.

## 2. Requirements

  **US 6.5.4:** As a healthcare staff member, I want to control the camera with the mouse.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- 6.5.4.1: The right button must enable orbit.
- 6.5.4.2: The wheel must enable zoom or dolly.

## 3. Analysis

The purpose of this functionality is to set up the camera to allow positional adjustments in response to mouse movements. Specifically:

* The right mouse button should enable orbit control around a focal point, allowing the user to rotate around an object or pan across the scene by holding the right button and moving the mouse.
* The mouse wheel should facilitate zooming (adjusting distance to the focal point) or dollying (moving the camera forward and backward in 3D space). This should provide smooth, intuitive zoom control, allowing the user to move closer to or further from the focal point naturally.

### 4.1. Realization
