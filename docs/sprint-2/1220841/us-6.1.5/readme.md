## 1. Context

This is the first time this user story is worked on.

## 2. Requirements

**US 6.1.5:** As Admin, I want the information about staff’s availability and operation schedule is in sync with the plan generated by the planning module.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- 6.1.5.1: The staff's availability and operation schedule must always be in a valid state, meaning no double booking.

- 6.1.5.2: The system must be reliable and maintain data integrity .

**Dependencies/References:**

This user story relies heavily on the user stories related to the planning module.

## 3. Analysis

The objective of this user story is to ensure that the staff availability and operation schedule accurately reflect any changes made in the planning module. This enables the Admin to have up-to-date, reliable data when making decisions about resource allocation and scheduling.

When the planning module generates a new plan, the staff’s availability and operation schedule should automatically update to reflect the latest information.

If a staff member’s availability changes , this change should propagate to the operation schedule and be reflected in the planning module Additionally, any adjustment to the schedule (e.g., rescheduling operations, changing operation rooms) should reflect both in the planning module and the displayed schedule for the Admin.
