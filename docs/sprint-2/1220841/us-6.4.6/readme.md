## 1. Context

This is the first time this user story is worked on.

## 2. Requirements

**US 6.4.6:** As system administrator, I want a backup strategy to be proposed, justified and implemented that minimizes RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and WRT (Work Recovery Time).

## 3. Analysis

The goal of this user story is to create and implement a backup plan that minimizes the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - the maximum tolerable period of data loss - and the Work Recovery Time (WRT), the time required to restore and verify the data and application.

To achieve this, it will be essential to determine the most effective approach, whether it involves full, partial, or a combination of backup types. Additionally, an optimal backup schedule should be set, with RPO and WRT kept to a minimum at all times.

### 4.1. Realization
