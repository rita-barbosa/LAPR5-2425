## 1. Context

This is the first time this US is being worked on.
This US pertains to the Admin.

## 2. Requirements

**US 6.4.1:** As system administrator, I want the deployment of one of the RFP modules in a DEI VM to be systematic, validating it on a scheduled bases with the test plan.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**US 6.4.1.1 -** The deployment of one of the RFP modules in a DEI VM is to be systematic. 

**US 6.4.1.2 -** Validating the module should be doen through regular testing.

**Dependencies/References:**

USs related to the BackOffice are going to depend on this implementation. 

**Client Clarifications:**

> None yet.

## 3. Analysis

After some consideration, it was agreed on the MDBackOffice to be the module that will be implemented in the DEI VM. 

In an effort to make the implementation be systematic, a *script* and *scheduled events* are going to be created to regularly run tests to check on the status of the module.
