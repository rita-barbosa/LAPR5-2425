### Observations

To ensure smooth project management and progress tracking, we've implemented the following aspects:

1. **Project Management Tool:** Jira has been chosen as our project management tool and will follow the same organizational setup we've previously used to maintain consistency.

2. **User Story Breakdown:** Each user story has been divided into smaller, manageable tasks in line with the engineering process. These tasks include analysis, requirements gathering, design, immediate implementation after design completion, and testing. This structure provides a clearer understanding of the progress for each user story and helps facilitate an organized division of commits, addressing concerns raised by some team members about work visibility and task tracking.

3. **Module Coordination:** We've designated a coordinator for each module, responsible for ensuring that all aspects of their module are well-integrated and properly implemented, which supports more effective cross-module consistency.

4. **Separation of Implementation and Testing:** In order to maintain objectivity and improve quality, the testing of each user story will be conducted by a team member other than the one who implemented it. This ensures that all code is reviewed and validated by a fresh perspective, helping to identify any overlooked issues.

5. **Code Reviews:** During the implementation phase, there will be at least one code review for each user story to ensure quality and adherence to coding standards. The code review will be performed by the same team member responsible for testing the user story. Additional reviews may be conducted based on the complexity and state of the project. This process helps in catching potential issues early and improves the overall quality of the codebase.

6. **Task Deadlines:** Deadlines have been set for each of the tasks to ensure the team consistently progresses towards project goals. This also ensures that everyone remains accountable, preventing anyone from falling behind or slacking off.

7. **Sprint Closure:** The final day of each sprint will be reserved for reviewing the work completed, conducting self-evaluations, and holding a sprint retrospective. This means that all planned tasks must be completed by the day before the sprint ends. If any tasks are left unfinished due to a lack of responsibility or effort from a team member, they will be held accountable in subsequent evaluations, reinforcing the importance of commitment and accountability.

8. **Daily Logs:** Each team member will maintain daily logs to track and document their work. This helps in providing transparency and allows for better progress tracking, ensuring that everyone is contributing to the project consistently.

These practices have been put in place to enhance team collaboration, ensure timely delivery of tasks, and maintain high-quality standards throughout the project.
