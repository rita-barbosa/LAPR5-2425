## 1. Context

This is the first time this user story is worked on.

## 2. Requirements

**US 6.5.2:** As a healthcare staff member, I want to see appropriate textures (that is, suitable for use in representing
a hospital or clinic) mapped onto the floor, walls, and so on.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **6.5.2.1:** The textures should be suitable for a hospital or clinic ambient.

**Dependencies/References:**

**US 6.5.1:** The 3D model should be created so the textures can be applied.
 

## 3. Analysis

To accomplish this user story, it's necessary to search for textures, suitable for a hospital or a clinic, for the
3D module that will be produced. For that will be search textures for the following places:

  * Floor
  * Walls
  * Door
  * Windows


## 4. Design
