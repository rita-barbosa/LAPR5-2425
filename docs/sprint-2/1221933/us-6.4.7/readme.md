## 1. Context

This is the first time this user story is worked on.

## 2. Requirements

**US 6.4.7:** As system administrator I want to define a public folder for all users registered on the system, where 
they can read whatever is placed there.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **6.4.7.1:** A public folder needs to be assigned to used as a public directory.

- **6.4.7.2:** The public folder needs to have all the users registered on the system, which will needs to give them the
permission to read all the content on that folder.

**Dependencies/References:**

This user story does not have dependencies.

## 3. Analysis

In this user story, a public folder will be created, where all the registered users on the system can read all the
information placed there.

For this, it will be needed to set up a public folder and then manage the access control to this folder.
