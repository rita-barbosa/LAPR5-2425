## 1. Context

This is the first time this user story is worked on.

## 2. Requirements

**US 6.1.1:** As user, I want to have an integrated UI for all modules of the system so that I donâ€™t need to switch 
between application urls.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **6.1.1.1:** The UI should have every module in a unique page to avoid switching between URLs.

- **6.1.1.2:** The user permissions should control the visibility of each module in the integrated UI.

**Dependencies/References:**

**US 6.1.2 & 6.1.3 & 6.1.4 & 6.1.5:** The UI for all the modules should be created first so can be integrated on one UI.

This user story will depend on the Angular to develop the integrated UI.

## 3. Analysis

To implement this user story, a single-page application (SPA) will be developed using Angular. The integrated UI should
have the follow elements: 

  * module specific areas
  * shared layout

It's important to unsure that the modules access respect the user permissions, so it is only access by users with the
right permissions.

## 4. Design
