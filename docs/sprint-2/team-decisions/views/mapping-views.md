## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the mapping between views of our system, offering a clear representation of how different views are interconnected.

## Logical - Development Views

### Level 2

**Nota:** This diagram illustrates the mapping between the logical and development views of our system. As shown, the GDPR component does not have a direct counterpart in the development view.

## Observations

The team decided to represent only the mapping from the Logical View to the Development View at Level 2, as it provided the most clarification. For the other views, the Logical and Development Views align, making additional diagrams unnecessary.
