## 1. Context

This is the first time this user story is worked on.

## 2. Requirements

**US 6.6.2:** As a System, I want to notify both users and the responsible authority in case of a data breach, so that I comply with GDPR’s breach notification requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **6.6.2.1:** The system automatically detects potential data breaches and immediately notifies both the affected users and the relevant GDPR authority. 
- **6.6.2.2:** Breach notifications to users includes steps being taken to mitigate the breach.  
- **6.6.2.3:** Breach notifications to users includes details of the breach (e.g., what data was compromised). 
- **6.6.2.4:** Breach notifications to users includes recommendations for users (e.g., changing passwords, monitoring for suspicious activity). 
- **6.6.2.5:** Notifications to the GDPR authority include detailed logs of the breach and actions taken. 
- **6.6.2.6:** Breach notifications are sent within the legally required timeframe (e.g., 72 hours).  
- **6.6.2.7:** The system logs all breach notifications and subsequent actions taken for auditing and compliance purposes. 

**Dependencies/References:**

The entire project is dependent on this US for the safety of the system and it's users.
