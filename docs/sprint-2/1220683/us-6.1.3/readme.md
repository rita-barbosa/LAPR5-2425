## 1. Context

This is the first time this user story is worked on.

## 2. Requirements

**US 6.1.3:** As healthcare staff, I want the information showed on the 3D visualization module about room availability 
to be in sync with the schedule that was generated by the planning module.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

No acceptance criteria yet.

**Dependencies/References:**

**Client Clarifications:**

## 3. Analysis

After the planning module providing a file with the schedule of the day for each surgical room, the 3D representation 
must reflect such schedule.

Each room must know its schedule and when It's available or not. When a surgery is happening, the 3D visualization must
adequately represent its occupation by displaying a patient laid down on the surgical table.
